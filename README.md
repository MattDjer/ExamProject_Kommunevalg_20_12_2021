# Start up
When you start the program a test user is created automatically:

Username: John
Password: Doe

Alternatively you are welcome to create your own user using the frontend.

The server starts on localhost:8080

# Database
You'll need to change settings in application.properties to fit your DB.
DB is then initialized and populated with dummy data. When the DB is created you should change 
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto"=create-drop" to "=update" if you want your data stored

To see the functionality with overview for party scores you'll need to change: 

root, password and URL in DatabaseConnection under the @Value tag. I have left some random credidentials as an example

# Navigation
There is no controller to avoid rendering through Thymeleaf. Instead navigation is done by JavaScript fecthing from 
RestControllers

# Tests
There are no UNIT tests since no part of the Java code contained enough logic to include a service layer, which 
is where testing is usually done. Instead the Java part mostly contains RestControllers and Repositories which 
are not usually tested upon. 

# Functionality
The functionality specified in the assignement is done. Though as mentioned before the assignenment contains no unit 
tests
